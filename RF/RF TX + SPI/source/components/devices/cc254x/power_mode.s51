*
*  Description:     Assembly file for handling alignment requirement for 
*                   entering power modes
*
*  Note             The PCON.IDLE = 1 instruction must be aligned to avoid 
*                   FLASH access to remain high and incur unnecessary power 
*                   consumption. The PCON.IDLE = 1 instruction must also be 
*                   aligned in order to make the execution of the next 
*                   instruction deterministic. 
* 
*                   The provided methods EnterSleepModeDisableInterruptsOnWakeup 
*                   and EnterSleepModeProcessInterruptsOnWakeup ensure 
*                   determnistic and predictable behaviour with respect to this 
*                   issue.
*
*                   Two more methods are also included to allow a pattern were 
*                   a global variable is written to PCON. This allows 
*                   applications from safeguarding against scenarios were 
*                   interrupt is raised after the decision to enter sleepmode 
*                   was taken.
